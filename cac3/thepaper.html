                style= "color: grey; text-decoration: none;">here</a>.</p>

            <h2>From the intro</h2>

            <blockquote>"The case for Western colonialism is about rethinking the past
              as well as improving the future. It involves reaffirming the primacy
              of human lives, universal values, and shared responsibilities –
              the civilising mission without scare quotes – that led to improvements
              in living conditions for most Third World peoples during most episodes
              of Western colonialism."
            </blockquote>



              <li style="text-align: left; background: none;">
                Gilley says there are three ways to reclaim colonialism-

                <ol style="text-align: left; background: none;">One is for governments and
                  peoples in developing countries to replicate as far as possible the colonial
                  governance of their pasts– as successful countries like Singapore,
                  Belize and Botswana did.</ol>

                  <ol style="text-align: left; background: none;">A second way is to recolonise
                    some areas. Western countries should be encouraged to hold power in specific
                    governance areas (public finances, say, or criminal justice) in order to
                    jump-start enduring reforms in weak states.</ol>

                    <ol style="text-align: left; background: none;">Thirdly,
                      in some instances it may be possible to build new Western
                      colonies from scratch.</ol>

                </li>




            <p>The event has led to a <i>retraction vs rebuttal</i> debate discussion online.
               These tweets appeared one after another when "Bruce Gilley" was entered into the search bar on Twitter.
            </p>

            <p>Colonialism can return (either as a governance style or as an extension of Western authority)
              only with the consent of the colonised. Yet now that the nationalist generation that forced
              sudden decolonisation on hapless populations has passed away, the time may be ripe.
            </p>



      <h2>On the research required</h2>

          <blockquote>"The objective costs/benefits approach identifies a certain need of human
            flourishing – development, security, governance, rights, etc. – and asks whether
            colonialism improved or worsened the objective provision of that need. "
          </blockquote>


    <div class= "textbox">
        <p>One main challenge of this research is to properly enumerate the things that
        matter and then to assign them weights, weights that presumably varied with time and place.
        </p>

        <p>
          In a brutally patriarchal society, for instance, access to justice for women may have been
          more important than the protection of indigenous land rights (which may be part of that patriarchy),
          as Andreski argued was the case for women in northern Nigeria under colonialism.
        </p>

        <p>A second challenge is measuring the counterfactual: what would likely have happened
           in a given place absent colonial rule?
        </p>

        <h2>Supposed benefits of colonialism</h2>

            <blockquote>"Countries that did not have a significant
              colonial history – China, Ethiopia, Liberia, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, Haiti and Guatemala,
              for instance –provide a measure of comparison to help identify what if anything were the
              distinctive effects of colonialism. So too does research into pre-colonial histories that,
              almost by definition, reveal comparatively weak institutions, divided societies and subsistence
              economies."
            </blockquote>


        <p>Such works (which are evidence based, such as work by
          Juan and Pierskalla) have found evidence for significant social, economic and political
          gains under colonialism: expanded education, improved public health, the abolition of slavery,
          widened employment opportunities, improved administration, the creation of basic infrastructure,
          female rights, enfranchisement of untouchable or historically excluded communities,
          fair taxation, access to capital, the generation of historical and cultural knowledge,
          and national identify formation, to mention just a few dimensions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Millions of people moved closer to areas of more intensive colonial rule, sent their children
          to colonial schools and hospitals, went beyond the call of duty in positions in colonial
          governments, reported crimes to colonial police, migrated from non-colonised to colonised areas,
          fought for colonial armies and participated in colonial political processes – all relatively
          voluntary acts.
        </p>

        <h2>Solutions</h2>

            <blockquote>"To solve the incentives problem, [Michael] Hechter has called for a ‘market in
              transnational governance’ which we might call less euphemistically ‘colonialism for hire’."
            </blockquote>


        <p>Colonial states would be paid for their services, an important motivator to be successful.
          The contractual motivation would also strengthen consent through periodic renegotiation of
          the terms. If properly designed, host countries would more than recoup those costs through
          higher foreign investment, lower external borrowing costs and greater business confidence,
          benefits that were arguably more significant than improved governance in the colonial era.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even with local legitimacy, Western will and a good plan, the challenges of making new forms
          of colonialism work are immense. Leaders will need to come up with novel solutions to continued
          chaos and displacement caused by a century of anti-colonial policies. So here is a
          modest idea: build new Western colonies from scratch.

          modest idea: build new Western colonies from scratch.

        </p>

        <p>In 2009, the economist Paul Romer – who became the World Bank’s chief economist in 2016 –
          suggested that rich nations build ‘charter cities’ in poor countries. Under this model,
          largely empty land is leased to a foreign nation or group of nations so that their sovereignty
          allows a modern enclave to grow up, as was the case in Hong Kong. That tiny British colony,
          according to Romer, ‘did more to reduce world poverty than all the aid programs that we’ve
          undertaken in the last century’.
        </p>

        <p>
          New colonies solve the three challenges above nicely. For the local population, they are
          legitimate because citizens choose to move there, escaping worse situations, and because
          their governments agree to the terms. They are potentially attractive to Western states
          because for conservatives they are low risk and self-financing while for liberals they are
          ‘acts of justice’. Finally, charter cities could be effective– which was Romer’s main concern
          in developing the idea – because they have a blank slate to transplant home institutions
          without having to work with rotten local ones.
        </p>

        <p>Back to Guinea-Bissau. Suppose that the government of Guinea-Bissau were to lease back to
          Portugal the small uninhabited island of Galinhas that lies 10 miles off the mainland and
          where the former colonial governor’s mansion lies in ruins. The annual lease would be US$1
          so that the Portuguese spend their money on the island and the Guinea-Bissau government is
          not dependent on a lease fee. Suppose, then, that the US$10 million to US$20 million in
          foreign aid wasted annually on the country were redirected to this new offshore colony to
          create basic infrastructure.
        </p>

        <p>
          As part of the deal, the Portuguese would allow a certain number of Guinea-Bissau residents
          to resettle on the island each year. Portuguese institutions and sovereignty would be absolute
          here for the term of the lease – say 99 years, as was the case with the main-land parts of
          Hong Kong. A small European state would grow up on the African coast.
        </p>

        <p>At 60 square miles, Galinhas could, over time, easily accommodate the entire population of
          Guinea-Bissau. If successful, it would attract talent, trade and capital. The mainland parts
          of Guinea-Bissau would benefit from living next to an economic dynamo and learning to emulate
          its success, while symbolically escaping from the half-century anti-colonial night-mare of
          Amilcar Cabral.
        </p>

        <p>A preposterous idea? Perhaps. But not so preposterous as the anti-colonial ideology
          that for the past 100 years has been haunting the lives of hundreds of millions of people
          in the Third World. A hundred years of disaster is enough. It is time to make the case for
          colonialism again.
